<h2> Summary</h2>
<p>
This dataset consists of parameters like area type, availability, location, size and other such features including price for each house. Data has been collected from Kaggle (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data"> dataset </a>). It would be very interesting to dive deeper into understanding the factors which lead to determine price. We would be using Machine Learning algorithms to build a model and predict these prices.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
Predicting the price of house or property (or any other product) is essential for many platforms like 99acres.com, magicbricks.com and others. In this project,<b>our goal is not only to predict the price of a house on the basis of different features but also to perform deep analysis on these features and their dependecy on each other</b>. Also, these inferences are very important, when it comes to business expanision and provide better suggestions to users of the product.
